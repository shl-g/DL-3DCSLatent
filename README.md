We haven't finished implementing our network yet.
The code is heavily based upon the Latent-NeRF by Elad Richardson and Gal Metzer.
Go read it at https://github.com/eladrich/latent-nerf.git !!!
Currently the only differences are inside the path src -> latent_nerf -> models
We've written the LatentPointCloudNERF tried changing a bit the trainer.py function to make it work.
We couldn't make it happen due to various, mostly sad, constraints that made time extremely precious this semester.
There really isn't nothing to look at here, but you should really read the document we written about it outlining its potential and general background behind it.
